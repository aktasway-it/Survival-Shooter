I refactored and improved [Sebastian Lague's project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SviIeTt2_Lc&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ctd4dgE1F8g3uec4zKNRV0) using all the modern Unity features (as of August 2023), such as Cinemachine, post processing, navigation etc.

Moreover I refactored the code using the singleton pattern for decoupling classes and dependecies.
